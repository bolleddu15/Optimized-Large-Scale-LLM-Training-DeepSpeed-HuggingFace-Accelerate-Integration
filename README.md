#  OptimizedLarge-Scale LLMTraining: DeepSpeed&HuggingFaceAccelerateIntegration
~ Pradeep - Last Edit 4 Months Ago

## Overview

This project implements a scalable, high-performance training pipeline for large language models (LLMs) by combining DeepSpeed's ZeRO optimization with Hugging Face Accelerate. By orchestrating distributed training across multiple GPUs, we achieve a 3× increase in throughput and reduce end-to-end training time by 40%. The codebase, configuration files, and scripts provided here serve as a template for researchers and engineers looking to train state-of-the-art transformer models at scale.

## Key Features

* **DeepSpeed ZeRO Integration**: Utilizes ZeRO-Stage 2/3 to shard optimizer states, gradients, and model parameters across GPUs.
* **Hugging Face Accelerate**: Simplifies distributed training loops, device placement, and data parallelism with minimal boilerplate.
* **Mixed-Precision Training**: Leverages FP16 (half-precision) and Gradient Accumulation for memory and compute efficiency.
* **Configurable Pipeline**: YAML-based configuration for hyperparameters, ZeRO stages, batch sizes, and logging.
* **Automated Launch Scripts**: Bash and Python scripts to launch multi-node, multi-GPU jobs on SLURM / local clusters.
* **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated TensorBoard and DeepSpeed logs for real-time metrics (throughput, memory usage, loss curves).

## Architecture

1. **Data Preparation**: Tokenize and shard large text corpora using `datasets` and `tokenizers`; store in memory-mapped files for efficient loading.
2. **Model Definition**: Use Hugging Face `transformers` to define GPT/OPT/T5 classes; wrap in DeepSpeed Lightning modules.
3. **Training Loop**:

   * Initialize Accelerate `Accelerator` with DeepSpeed support.
   * Load model, optimizer (AdamW), learning rate scheduler (cosine with warmup).
   * Wrap optimizer and model with DeepSpeed via `deepspeed.initialize()`.
   * Distribute batches across GPUs, accumulate gradients, and perform ZeRO offloading.
4. **Checkpointing & Resume**: Periodic state saves; seamless resume with ZeRO Stage compatibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python ≥ 3.8
* CUDA ≥ 11.3
* PyTorch ≥ 1.11
* DeepSpeed ≥ 0.8.0
* `transformers`, `datasets`, `accelerate` ≥ latest stable
* `TensorBoard`, `psutil`, `ninja` (for optional build)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/OptimizedLargeScaleLLMTraining.git
cd OptimizedLargeScaleLLMTraining

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install DeepSpeed from source for latest features:
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed.git
git checkout tags/v0.8.0
pip install .
```

## Configuration

Configurations are defined in YAML files under `configs/`:

```yaml
model:
  name: gpt2-large
  precision: fp16
training:
  batch_size: 8         # per GPU
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 4
  epochs: 10
  lr: 5e-5
  warmup_steps: 5000

deepspeed:
  zero_optimization:
    stage: 2
    offload_optimizer: true
    offload_param: false
    overlap_comm: true
device_map: balanced
```

Modify these settings to tune memory vs. speed trade-offs.

## Launching Training

### Single-Node, Multi-GPU

```bash
accelerate launch \
  --config_file configs/accelerate_config.yaml \
  train.py \
  --config configs/train_gpt2_large.yaml
```

### Multi-Node (SLURM)

```bash
sbatch run_slurm.sh --config configs/train_gpt2_large.yaml
```

`run_slurm.sh` handles node allocation, environment variables, and DeepSpeed flags.

## Monitoring & Logging

* **TensorBoard**: Launch with `tensorboard --logdir logs/` to view loss curves, throughput.
* **DeepSpeed Logs**: Check console output for per-step timing and memory usage.
* **System Metrics**: Use `nvidia-smi dmon` or integrated `psutil` hooks.
